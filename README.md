 <h1>Introduction</h1>
 <p> Here's a short summary of things my team will do according to the tasks inside the issues folder: </p>
 <p> We have already started issues and created a project board. Once the README.md file is set up, we will show our team to the Internet,
 ensure that pull requests are added in the correct columns, write a code in C, update the web page https://csci3251-2020.github.io/, and lastly promote our repo </p>
 # Code
 ```ruby
 {% include_relative code.c %}
